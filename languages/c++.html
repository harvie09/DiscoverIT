                <h1>History of C++</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    The C++ language is an object-oriented programming language & is a combination of both low-level & high-level language – a Middle-Level Language.
                    <br><br>
                    C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, starting in 1979 at Bell Labs (now known as Nokia Bell Labs). It evolved from the C programming language, with the intention of adding object-oriented programming features.
                    <br><br>
                    C++ was initially known as “C with classes, ” and was renamed C++ in 1983. ++ is shorthand for adding one to variety in programming; therefore C++ roughly means that “one higher than C.”

                <h1>Why Use C++ Language?</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    C++ is one of the world's most popular programming languages.
                    <br><br>
                    C++ can be found in today's operating systems, Graphical User Interfaces, and embedded systems.
                    <br><br>
                    C++ is an object-oriented programming language which gives a clear structure to programs and allows code to be reused, lowering development costs.
                    <br><br>
                    C++ is portable and can be used to develop applications that can be adapted to multiple platforms.
                    <br><br>
                    C++ is fun and easy to learn!
                    <br><br>
                    As C++ is close to C, C# and Java, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to C++ or vice versa.
                </p>

                <h1>Difference between C and C++</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    C++ was developed as an extension of C, and both languages have almost the same syntax.
                    <br><br>
                    The main difference between C and C++ is that C++ support classes and objects, while C does not.
                </p>
                <br><br>

                <h1>Get Started with C++</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    To start using C++, you need two things:
                    <br>
                    1. A <a>text editor</a>, like Notepad, to write C++ code <br>
                    2. A <a>compiler</a>, like GCC, to translate the C++ code into a language that the computer will understand
                    <br>
                    There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this tutorial, we will use an IDE (see below).
                </p>

                <h1>Install IDE</h1>
                <p class="content">
                        An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code.
                        <br><br>
                        Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C++ code.
                        <br><br>
                        Note: Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited.
                        <br><br>
                        We will use Code::Blocks in our tutorial, which we believe is a good place to start.
                        <br><br>    
                        You can find the latest version of Codeblocks at http://www.codeblocks.org/. Download the mingw-setup.exe file, which will install the text editor with a compiler.
                </p>

                <h1>C++ Quickstart</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    Let's create our first C++ file.
                    <br><br>
                    Open Codeblocks and go to File > New > Empty File.
                    <br><br>
                    Write the following C++ code and save the file as myfirstprogram.cpp (File > Save File as):
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                
                <div class="container">
                    <h2>myfirstprogram.cpp</h1>
                    <img src="../img/c++.PNG" >
                </div>

                <br><br>

                <p class="content">
                    Don't worry if you don't understand the code above - we will discuss it in detail in later. For now, focus on how to run the code.
                    <br><br>
                    In Codeblocks, it should look like this:
                    <br><br>

                    <br><br>
                    Then, go to <a>Build</a> > <a>Build and Run</a> to run (execute) the program. The result will look something to this:
                </p>

                    <a>Line 1:</a> #include <iostream> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output objects, such as cout (used in line 5). Header files add functionality to C++ programs.
                    <br><br>
                    <a>Line 2:</a> using namespace std means that we can use names for objects and variables from the standard library.
                    <br><br>    
                    <a>Line 3:</a> A blank line. C++ ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.

                    <a>Line 4:</a> Another thing that always appear in a C++ program is int main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
