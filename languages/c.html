                <h1>History of C language</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    The history of C programming language is quite interesting. C was
                    originally designed for and implemented on the UNIX operating system on
                    the DEC PDP-ll, by Dennis Ritchie. C is the result of a development
                    process that started with an older language called BCPL. BCPL was
                    developed by Martin Richards, and it influenced a language called B,
                    which was invented by Ken Thompson. B led to the development of C in
                    the 1970s.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For many years, the de facto standard for C was the version supplied with
                    the UNIX operating system. In the summer of 1983, a committee was
                    established to create an ANSI (American National Standards Institute)
                    standard that would define the C language. The standardization process
                    took six years (much longer than anyone reasonably expected).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The ANSI C standard was finally adopted in December 1989, with the first copies becoming available in early 1990. The
                    standard was also adopted by ISO (International Standards Organization), and the resulting standard was typically referred 3
                    to as ANSI/ISO Standard C. In 1995, Amendment 1 to the C standard was adopted, which, among other things, added
                    several new library functions. The 1989 standard for C, along with Amendment 1, became a base document for Standard
                    C++, defining the C subset of C++. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The version of C defined by the 1989 standard is commonly referred to as C89.
                    During the 1990s, a new standard for C was being developed. It was the 1999 standard for C, usually referred to as C99. In
                    general, C99 retained nearly all of the features of C89. The C99 standardization committee focused on two main areas: the
                    addition of several numeric libraries and the development of some special-use, but highly innovative, new features, such as
                    variable-length arrays and the restrict pointer qualifier. These innovations have once again put C at the forefront of computer
                    language development. C89 is the version of C in widest use, it is currently accepted by all C compilers, and it forms the
                    basis for C++.

                <h1>Get Started with C</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    To start using C, you need two things:
                    <br>
                    1. A <a>text editor</a>, like Notepad, to write C code <br>
                    2. A <a>compiler</a>, like GCC, to translate the C code into a language that the computer will understand
                    <br>
                    There are many text editors and compilers to choose from. In this tutorial, we will use an IDE (see below).
                </p>

                <h1>Install IDE</h1>
                <p class="content">
                        An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is used to edit AND compile the code.
                        <br><br>
                        Popular IDE's include Code::Blocks, Eclipse, and Visual Studio. These are all free, and they can be used to both edit and debug C code.
                        <br><br>
                        Note: Web-based IDE's can work as well, but functionality is limited.
                        <br><br>
                        We will use Code::Blocks in our tutorial, which we believe is a good place to start.
                        <br><br>    
                        You can find the latest version of Codeblocks at http://www.codeblocks.org/. Download the mingw-setup.exe file, which will install the text editor with a compiler.
                </p>

                <h1>C Quickstart</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    Let's create our first C file.
                    <br><br>
                    Open Codeblocks and go to File > New > Empty File.
                    <br><br>
                    Write the following C code and save the file as myfirstprogram.c (File > Save File as):
                    <br><br>
                </p>
                
                <div class="container">
                    <h2>myfirstprogram.c</h1>

                </div>

                <br><br>

                <p class="content">
                    Don't worry if you don't understand the code above - we will discuss it in detail in later. For now, focus on how to run the code.
                    <br><br>
                    In Codeblocks, it should look like this:
                    <br><br>

                    <img src="../img/codeblocks2020.png">
                    <br><br>
                    Then, go to <a>Build</a> > <a>Build and Run</a> to run (execute) the program. The result will look something to this:
                </p>

                    Congratulations! You have now written and executed your first C program.

                <h1>C Program Structure</h1>
                <p class="content">
                    A C program basically consists of the following parts − <br><br>
                    • Preprocessor Commands/Directives <br>
                    • main() Function <br>
                    • Statements & Expressions <br>
                    • Comments
                    <br><br>
                    Take a look at a simple code that will display the word “Hello World” on your screen/monitor.
                    <br><br>
                    <img src="../img/c2.PNG">
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="content">
                    Each line of the program is explained below: 
                    <br>
                    • The first line of the program #include <stdio.h> is a preprocessor command, which tells a C compiler to include
                    stdio.h file before going to actual compilation. C commands are organized into libraries and .h is the extension name
                    of the C libraries. stdio.h is the library that covers the input and output commands of C. <br><br>
                    • The next line int main () is the main function where the program execution begins. <br><br>
                    • The next line /*...*/ will be ignored by the compiler and it has been put to add additional comments in the program.
                    So, such lines are called comments in the program. You can use comments to remind the programmer of what the
                    program/statement does. <br><br>
                    • The next line printf(...) is another function available in C which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed
                    on the screen. <br><br>
                    • The next line is return 0; terminates the program execution. <br><br>
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <p class="content">
                    Therefore, the basic C program structure is shown below: <br><br>
                    #preprocessor directives <br>
                    main() <br>
                        { <br>
                        /* statements */ <br>
                        } <br><br>
                        Between the curly braces { } are the codes or statements that will be included in your program. The succeeding lessons
                        covers the elements of programming that is needed in solving a problem with C language.

                <p class="content">
                    A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.
                    <br><br>
                    In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.
                    <br><br>
                    The following statement "instructs" the compiler to print the text "Hello World" to the screen:
                    <br><br>

                <p class="content">
                    Most C programs contain many statements.
                    <br><br>
                    The statements are executed, one by one, in the same order as they are written:

                <p class="content">
                    From the example above, we have three statements:
                    <br><br>
                    1. <a>printf("Hello World!");</a> <br>

                    <br>
                    The first statement is executed first (print "Hello World!" to the screen).
                    Then the second statement is executed (print "Have a good day!" to the screen).
                    And at last, the third statement is executed (end the C program successfully).
